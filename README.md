# Time-Series-Predictions-Using-LSTM-and-SARIMA

## SECTION 1, Model

"codes" and "notebook" are LSTM and SARIMA codes in python and jupyter notebook, respectively. 

"Time_Series_Prediction.pptx" provides more details about model performance.

The data used here are vehicle trip records in New York from 2015 to mid 2018


## SECTION 2, Web Visulization

<b> NOTE: dataset here is the US zillow house prices, predictive model used here is LSTM from a previous project. </b>

To check the result, run a python server with the "visualization/UI" folder as root.
